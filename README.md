# State-Managed-Insurance-System
A production-style demo that implements state-based insurance decision-making inspired by battery management systems. Using μHSM health state monitoring, this project compares prediction-based vs state-based decisions with Docker, MLflow, MySQL, and CI pipelines to show how observability stabilizes decisions without changing models.
